Code Book

This code book modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information in tidy.x.

Identifiers

subject - The ID given to the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were recorded


Measurements

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. 
- Each feature vector is a row on the 'X' and 'y' files. 
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2). (Acc)
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg. (Gyro)
